## simulation

# Question
Write a C or Java program to implement the single queue single server discrete event
simulation model with 1000 runs. Assume the inter arrival and service times are
distributed as exponential random variables with mean 1 minute for the inter arrival
times and mean 0.5 minute for the service times. Output the three measures of
performance namely; the average delay in queue, the average number of customers in
queue, and the proportion of time the server is busy.


# How to run
Open cmd in the Queue.java path
Compile using ```javac Queue.java```
Run ```java Queue```
